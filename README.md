This repo contains the code created from different modules during my education. It includes the following Modules: Java, Further Java, Machine Learning, Algorithms, Group Project, Final Year Project.

My role during the group project was primarily concerned with the patient registration and PEWS calculation aspects of the app.

Note that some of the code contains references to classes and datasets that I can't upload due to Licensing and may not be functional.
